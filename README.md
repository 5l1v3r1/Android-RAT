# Complete Backdoor Access To Android Devices
The AndriodRAT is a fully functioning remote access tool that uses a reverse shell to access a device.
The AndriodRAT can be made to be persistent, meaning that access to a remote andriod device can be maintained even after restarting the device.
The AndriodRAT can also be made to be non-persistent, no traces will be left behind after the device is powered off.

## This application is maintained and consistently beats all anti-virus software!
